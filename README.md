# FFXIV-LazyLoot 

Plugin for Final Fantasy XIV (Originally by 53m1k0l0n)

Various commands to need, greed, or pass on all loot. Chat and Toast output and delay for rolling. Configurable to optionally always pass certain items, like if an item level doesnt met your minimum requirement or if the item (Minion, Cards, Musics, etc) is already unlocked (item has a checkmark).

# Commands

* `/lazy` : Open Lazy Loot config.
* `/fulf` : Enable or Disable FULF (Fancy Ultimate Lazy Feature), which will roll items automatically for you, based on your settings.
* `/rolling need` : Roll need for everything. If impossible roll greed or pass if need or greed isn't successful.
* `/rolling needonly` : Roll need for everything. If impossible, roll pass.
* `/rolling greed` : Roll greed on all items or pass if greed isn't successful.
* `/rolling pass` : Pass on things you haven't rolled for yet.
* `/rolling passall` : Passes on all, even if you rolled on them previously.
